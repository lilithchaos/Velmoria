Despite the hardships, a community spirit thrives, with shared meals and cooperative efforts common. The slums are a hub for smugglers and black-market traders, who operate under the watchful eyes of corrupt city guards.  Some of the streets are lit by faerie magic.]",

Drakenshard maintains a tense but respectful relationship with Ironhold to the north, often competing in skirmishes over contested borderlands.\n\nThough warlike and disciplined, Drakenshard is not without honor; the monarchy follows a strict code of valor, rewarding bravery and service with titles, wealth, and land. However, betrayal or weakness is met with swift and merciless justice.\n\nOnly the strong survive in Drakenshard, and only the strongest rule.]",
